API todos:	
	- (important!) ability to specify directionality, for stop numbers that
	  service both directions of a route.  Transitway stops will not work
	  otherwise.
	- interface to the trip planner
	- ability to fetch all schedules for a particular stop, rather than
	  only one route
	- find stops based on intersections, landmarks, etc, rather than by
	  stop number.  Particularly useful would be fetching Transitway stops
	  by name.
	- documented YAML/JSON/XML/whatever format for saving/exporting schedules
	- fetch based on 'weekday' or 'weekend' date spec, rather than an actual date
	- specifying before/after times for finding a particular run
	- selecting times for special routes (176X, 7A, etc)
	- in-memory and/or on-disk caching of raw pages (LWP has support for this?)
	- memoize schedule_for_stop() and other future calls, to avoid repeated
	  HTTP requests in the same process for the same schedules.
	- caching (Cache::xxx modules?) of parsed stop data for use across
	  invocations.

API user hacks:
	- script for pretty-printing a schedule
	- better script for re-webifying the schedule data as a REST-ish webpage
	- SMS gateway
	- Google Maps mashup
	- floor wax AND dessert topping
	- etc, etc
